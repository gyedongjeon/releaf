# Re:Leaf v0.2.0 Release Notes

## Features

-   **Onboarding**: Introduced a tutorial flow to guide first-time users through the Re:Leaf experience.
-   **Save Settings**: User preferences (theme, font size, margins) are now persisted automatically via Chrome Storage.

## Bug Fixes

-   **2-Page View Layout**: Fixed an issue where the last page in 2-page view would sometimes display duplicated content or an empty column. This was resolved by implementing strict column width calculations and a virtual overscroll mechanism (PR #16).
-   **Last Page Navigation**: Fixed a bug where users could navigate past the last page into empty space. Added boundary checks to navigation logic (PR #17).

## Technical Details

-   Updated `src/content.js` with new `updateLayout`, `setScrollPosition`, `getVirtualScroll`, and `getTotalPages` helpers.
-   Updated `src/styles.css` to use `--releaf-column-width` CSS variable.
-   Comprehensive unit test coverage for new logic.
