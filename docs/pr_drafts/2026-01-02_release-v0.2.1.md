# Release v0.2.1: Robust Content Extraction

## Summary
This release focuses on resolving critical content extraction issues on major news platforms (New York Times and BBC News) and improving the reading experience for multimedia content.

## Key Features & Fixes

### 1. BBC News Video Support
- **Interactive Video Placeholders**: Replaces blank video areas with a visible poster image and a "Play Video" button.
- **Deep Content Extraction**: Implemented Shadow DOM traversal to locate high-quality poster images hidden in BBC's custom players.
- **Click-to-Restore**: Users can now click the video placeholder to exit Reader Mode and watch the video on the original page.

### 2. New York Times Lead Images
- **Improved Heuristics**: Fixed a bug where minor body images blocked the extraction of high-quality lead images from the article header.
- **Noise Reduction**: Enhanced filtering to ignore ad-related elements while preserving media content.

### 3. Architecture & Refactoring
- **Modularization**: Split the monolithic `content.js` into focused modules:
    - `src/content/utils.js`: Core extraction logic.
    - `src/content/ui.js`: DOM generation.
    - `src/content/main.js`: Orchestration and events.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Added GitHub Actions workflow to run unit tests automatically on PRs.
- **Test Structure**: Split unit tests to match the new module structure, improving maintainability.

### 4. System Improvements
- **Robustness**: Updated attribute sanitization to allow interactive elements (`data-action`) and proper styling.
- **Testing**: Added comprehensive unit tests for video transformation and complex page structures.

## Verification
