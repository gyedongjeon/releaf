# Release v0.2.2: Navigation Bug Fix

## Summary
This release addresses a critical bug in the reader view navigation where clicking "Previous" would skip a page under specific conditions.

## Key Fixes
- **Navigation Logic**: Fixed an off-by-one error in `src/content/main.js` caused by `Math.floor` behavior when the scroll position was perfectly aligned with a page boundary.
- **Reliability**: Navigation is now handled using `Math.round` to correctly determine the current page index before applying offsets, ensuring consistent behavior.

## Verification
- **Regression Test**: Added `Bug Repro: Should navigate to previous page correctly` to `test/content/main.test.js`, confirming the fix.
- **Full Suite**: All 39 unit tests are passing.

## Checklist
- [x] Version bumped to `0.2.2`.
- [x] Automated tests passing.
- [x] No breaking changes.
