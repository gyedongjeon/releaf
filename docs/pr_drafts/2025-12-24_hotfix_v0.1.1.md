# PR: Hotfix v0.1.1 - Permissions & Host Review

## Summary
Urgent fix for Chrome Web Store publishing. Removes the broad `matches: ["<all_urls>"]` host permission, which triggers invasive manual reviews.

## Changes
-   **Manifest Update**: Removed `content_scripts` section that auto-injected on every page.
-   **Architecture Shift**: The extension now relies entirely on `activeTab` permission. Scripts are only injected dynamically when the user clicks the extension icon (handled by `src/background.js`).
-   **Version Bump**: `0.1.0` -> `0.1.1`.

## Impact
-   **Pros**: Faster review time, less scary permissions for users ("Read and change all your data on all websites" -> "Read and change data on the active tab").
-   **Cons**: No change. Dynamic injection was already implemented as a fallback and now becomes the primary method.

## Checklist
-   [x] Manifest validates.
-   [x] Background script injection logic confirmed.
