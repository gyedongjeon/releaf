**Context**: User requested Git Flow setup, Chrome Extension scaffolding, and chat archiving.

**Changes**:
- Initialized `develop` branch and `feature/mv3-scaffolding` branch.
- Created `manifest.json`, `src/background.js`, `src/content.js`, `src/styles.css`.
- Added `test/content.test.js` and set up `jest`.
- Created `.gitignore` with standard patterns.
- Created `docs/sessions/` to store session logs (corrected from `.agent/chats/`).

**Decisions**:
- Used standard "Clean Code" structure for the extension.
- Adopted Manifest V3 generally as it is strict requirement for new extensions.
- Switched to `feature/` branch after initial direct commit to `develop` to strictly follow Git Flow.

**Next Steps**:
- Continue implementing "Ebook View" features.
- Verify extension on real webpages.
